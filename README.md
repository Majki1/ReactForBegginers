# React Project Guide

This is a simple React application built with TypeScript and Vite. Follow the steps below to get the development environment running.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Node.js installed on your machine. It is recommended to use the latest LTS (Long-Term Support) version.

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

You can check if you have Node.js and npm installed by running the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository** (or download the source code).

2.  **Navigate to the project directory** in your terminal:

    ```bash
    cd path/to/your/project
    ```

3.  **Install the dependencies** using npm:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    This command will download all the necessary packages defined in the `package.json` file.

### Running the Development Server

Once the installation is complete, you can start the local development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the Vite development server. You can now view the application in your web browser at the local address provided in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`). The server supports Hot Module Replacement (HMR), so any changes you make to the source code will be reflected in the browser automatically.
